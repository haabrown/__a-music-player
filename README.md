# __a-music-player
This repository hold my attempt to create a desktop music/video/Youtube player using wxPy.

The data file contains images I created myself so that anyone working on this project may use them. All sound and data files should come from the users personal collection and should not be pushed to the repository - we don't want any copyright issues.
