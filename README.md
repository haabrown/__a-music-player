# __a-music-player
This repository hold my attempt to create a desktop music/video/Youtube player using wxPy.

The data file contains images I created myself so that anyone working on this project may use them. Spare_Data and Sounds are expected to be provided by the user - these files will most likely hold the users owh music, which I have no authority to publish online. Please do not push any files you do not own and have permission to publish to the web.
